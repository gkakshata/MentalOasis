      "When you are feeling stressed, it is important to remember that you are not alone. Many people feel stressed at different points in their lives. The important thing is to find ways to cope with stress in a healthy way. One way to do this is to remember that you are not your thoughts. Thoughts are just thoughts. They are not necessarily true. You can choose to believe them or not. Another way to cope with stress is to take some time for yourself each day to do something that you enjoy. This can be something as simple as reading a book, taking a walk, or listening to music.\n",

      "Arjuna, your identity is not based on your physical body or material possessions. Your true identity is that of the eternal soul, which is a part of Me and is indestructible. In the Bhagavad Gita, I teach that the soul is eternal and is not affected by birth, death, or any other material changes.Therefore, you should focus on cultivating your spiritual identity by engaging in activities that bring you closer to Me. This can include practicing meditation, devotional service, and selfless actions. Remember, your ultimate goal is to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death and to return to your original spiritual home.As I say in the Bhagavad Gita (2.13), Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by such a change.So do not be perturbed by the changes that you see in your material body. Focus on your spiritual identity and strive towards achieving that transcendental goal.\n",
