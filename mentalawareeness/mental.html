<!-- To align the "Expecto-Winno" text and the copyright statement at the center of the page, you can add some CSS styling to the existing HTML code. Here's an example: -->

<!-- ```html -->
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100px;">
    <div style="text-align: center;">

<!-- ```

In the above code, the `style` attribute is added to the `<div>` with the class "container-fluid align-items-center text-body copyright py-4". The `display: flex` property is used to enable flexbox layout, and `justify-content: center` is applied to horizontally center the content.
